# Description

This is a template for a Python project. 
It includes a basic project structure, a Dockerfile, a requirements.txt file a README.md file, etc.
The goal of this template is to provide a starting point for a Python project. Once you have cloned this repository, 
you can start by changing the `attributes` of the project using the `change_project_attributes.py` script with
the following command:
```bash
python change_project_attributes.py --help
```

Then you can start developing your project by adding your code to the `src` directory.


The project is constituted by the following parts:

- **.github**: This directory contains the GitHub Actions workflows that are responsible for
  - running the tests: `.github/workflows/tests.yml`
  - build the distribution: `.github/workflows/build_dist.yml`
  - build the documentation: `.github/workflows/docs.yml`
- **data**: This directory will contain the data that will be used and generated by the project.
- **dist**: This directory will contain the distribution of the project.
- **docs**: This directory will contain the documentation of the project.
- **images**: This directory will contain the images that will be used in the README.md file or in the documentation.
- **sphinx**: This directory contains the configuration of the Sphinx documentation.
- **src**: This directory will contain the source code of the project. This is where you will add your own sauce.
- **tests**: This directory will contain the tests of the project.
- **docker_files**: This directory contains the scripts that will help you build the docker image and run the 
   project in a container.
- *Dockerfile*: This file is responsible for building the docker image of the project.
- *.gitattributes*: This file is responsible for setting the git attributes of the project.
- *.gitignore*: This file is responsible for ignoring the files that you don't want to commit to the repository.
   A basic one is already provided and should be enough for most of the projects.
- *requirements.txt*: This file is responsible for listing the dependencies of the project.
- *pyproject.toml*: This file is responsible for listing the dependencies of the project and the 
   configuration of the project.
- *README.md*: This file is responsible for providing information about the project.
   A basic structure is provided after this little introduction.
- *change_project_attributes.py*: This script is responsible for changing the attributes of the project.
   Feel free to remove it once you used it.
- *setup.py*: This file is responsible for setting up the project.
- *LICENSE*: This file is responsible for providing the license of the project.
- *run_pytests.py*: This script is used by the github actions to run the tests.

# README TEMPLATE

## Installation
### Development Dependencies

With `python` and `pip` installed, run the following commands to install the dependencies:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

With `poetry` installed, run the following commands to install the dependencies:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
poetry install
```

## Scripting Usage
To run a single training, you can run the following command:
```bash
python -m <package_name> <your_parameters>
```
and to know the parameters you can use the help command:
```bash
python -m <package_name> --help
```

### Deployment
You will need to install Docker to run the trainings in a container. 
You can install Docker by following the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

To build the docker image of the project you can run the following command:
```bash
docker build -t <package_name>:latest .
```

The container can be run in two different modes: 

- **release**: This mode is responsible for running the __main__.py of the current package. 
- **it**: This is a development mode that is responsible for running the container in the interactive mode.

To run a mode `<mode>` you can run the following command:
```bash
docker run --name <package_name>-<phase> --detach --rm --volume=<data_path>:/<ROOT_DIR>/data -e "MODE=<mode>" <package_name>:latest <your_arguments>
```
where `<data_path>` is the absolute path in your local machine where you want to store the data generated by the phase.
The `<ROOT_DIR>` is the root directory of the project.

There is another way you can do all of this. You can use the `docker_files/build_image_and_run.py` script. This script
will build the image and run the mode you want. You can run the script with the following command:
```bash
python docker_files/build_image_and_run.py --mode=<mode>
```
